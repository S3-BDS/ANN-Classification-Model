# ANN-Classification-Model
Implemented 3 Models of ANN accordingly for our Mobile Price prediction project in which the model provided an accuracy of 95% and then the other two gave an accuracy of 94%. Model performance can be influenced by various factors including architecture, data preprocessing, hyperparameters, and the nature of the dataset itself.
